## Side Chosen: Anti-Targeted Advertising
### Reasoning: 
I've recently started reading some of Jaron Lanier (early computer scientist and "father of VR"). He writes a lot on the monetization and centralization of the Internet in contrast with its original principle of open source and decentralized. His arguments were why I raised the question of the lost value of consumers when exchanging our data for free services.

Personally, I am extremely against targeted ads because I am against ads in general and am thus against effective ads. There's no doubt that targeted ads sway more people to buy a product than general ads. However, I think that ads generate an artificial demand for unnecessary products and thus encourage people to waste money.

I think there is more to the economic story I tried to paint with the charts in the presentation, but it's hard to find data quickly on the true value of personal data. I believe it would be better for a digital marketplace to exist where users could choose to sell their data in exchange for money, which they could then use to buy previously free services. The Internet was built for transparency and this would be a huge step.

(The only issue is that they would probably be exchanged for crypto, and do not get me started on crypto.)
